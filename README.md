## Exposure App
A photo editing app created using React, styled-components, and css blend modes. This is a small passion project I'll be updating over time as I learn new things in React or when I want to experiment with something new.

**Focus Points**
- Use Hooks in React
- Make my own animated hamburger menu (just something I've been wanting to do :P)
- Experiment with CSS Blend Modes
- Experiment with using styled-components
- Experiment with an animation library (react-spring)
- Have fun and make something beautiful!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
